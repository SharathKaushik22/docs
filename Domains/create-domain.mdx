description: 'Creating Domain.'

In SplashBI, domains are organizational units that help manage and structure data sources by grouping related tables, views, synonyms and other database objects. They allow for the creation and editing of these groups, configuration of settings like default database connections and security modules, and support for drill-down functionality to extract detailed information from reports. Domains can also include predefined lists of values (LOVs) for filtering and selection in reports, and they can be imported or exported to share data models across different environments or teams.
